                Spider-Man is another iconic superhero from Marvel Comics, created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko. He first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15 in August 1962.
                Peter Parker is a high school student who gained his superpowers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. The bite endowed him with the proportionate strength, agility, and reflexes of a spider, as well as the ability to cling to walls and a "spider-sense" that warns him of danger. After the death of his Uncle Ben, Peter adopts the motto "With great power comes great responsibility" and becomes the masked vigilante known as Spider-Man.            </p>
