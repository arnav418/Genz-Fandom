                The Hulk is a famous superhero from Marvel Comics, created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby. He first appeared in The Incredible Hulk #1 in May 1962.
                Bruce Banner is a brilliant scientist who was exposed to high levels of gamma radiation during an experiment gone wrong. The experiment was intended to create a super-soldier serum, but instead, it triggered a transformation within Banner. Whenever he becomes angry or stressed, he transforms into the Hulk, a massive, green-skinned creature with incredible strength and near-invulnerability. This transformation is often uncontrollable, making the Hulk both a hero and a dangerous force.
