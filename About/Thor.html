                Thor is a prominent superhero in Marvel Comics, based on the Norse god of thunder from mythology. He was created by writer Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, and artist Jack Kirby, making his first appearance in Journey into Mystery #83 in August 1962.
                Thor is the prince of Asgard, a realm of powerful beings known as the Asgardians. He is the son of Odin, the All-Father, and the goddess Frigga. As the god of thunder, Thor wields the enchanted hammer Mjolnir, which grants him immense power and can only be lifted by those who are deemed "worthy."
