                <span>Captain America</span> is a fictional superhero appearing in comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 in March 1941.
                Steve Rogers was a frail young man during World War II who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum developed by the U.S. government. He then became the patriotic super-soldier Captain America. He fought against the Axis powers during the war, primarily against his arch-nemesis, the Red Skull.
